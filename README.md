# dqn_pytorch
Very basic dqn with replay implemented in pytorch. All code is taken from pytorch DQN tutorial at https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html

I just broke it up into different files/functions the way I like it. This repository is mainly to easily grab and clone, making it understandable and straightforward (not quite as much as the tutorial) with the main intention to try out different ideas on a basic deep off-policy algorithm
